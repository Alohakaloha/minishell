as beautiful as a shell

This project is about creating your very own shell.
##  What is a shell?
In short a shell is a command-line interpreter or in some cases a graphical user interface.
Our shell takes input from the user and executes programs based on that input.

1. We check for pipes (pipes inside of quotes are ignored) -> then everything is being split into blocks.
2. The blocks are then checked if they contain single or double quotes.
